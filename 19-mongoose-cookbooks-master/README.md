# Mongoose Cookbook Authors

Follow along as I build out a very simple application to demonstrate:

- Defining Mongoose Schemas and Models
- Validating a Schema
- Querying a Schema

## Instructions

1.  Clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.

Solution code is available on the `solution` branch.

## Step 1: Connect to Mongoose

Establish a connection to the database inside of a `connection.js` file. You'll
need to install `mongoose` for that and have your MongoDB database running!

## Step 2: Define a Schema

Use the mongoose `Schema` class to define a schema for an Author. Then use
`mongoose.model()` to turn it into a model.

## Step 3: Validate Your Schema

Add custom validation to your schema. This will ensure objects stored in the
collection are consistent!

## Step 4: Query Your Model

This is a tease of a future lesson. We're going to demonstrate simple queries,
so that we can see that our model is doing what it's supposed to be. Namely:
interfacing with MongoDB!

# Portfolio Pages

## Instructions

Create a personal portfolio page using HTML and CSS and deploy it to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Please refer to the documentation on GitHub for detailed instructions!

## Requirements

- Separation of concerns: HTML is strictly for content, CSS is strictly for style. 
- Your CSS and HTML should be in separate files.
- Your HTML should pass the [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)).
- Your CSS should pass the [W3 CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)).
- No JavaScript required! 
- Uses a CSS Media Query to have two different layouts for small and large screens (aka [responsive design](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-cosmic-binturongs/responsive-design))
- Deployed to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a free hosting service provided by GitHub. You should name your repository `your-username.github.io`. The result is that your page will be publicly available at http://your-username.github.io.

> You have not been taught how to deploy to Github Pages. That's okay! This is an opportunity to learn something new on your own. Just follow the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/). If you run into any issues, just ask for help.

### Submission

Please **create an issue on this repo**, containing a link to the **repo** you created -- not the webpage. Your issue should contain `http://github.com/seidcstudent/seidcstudent.github.io`, for example, and **not** `http://seidcstudent.github.io`.

## Pairing with Others

Every student must create their *own* website, but you're **welcome and encouraged** to collaborate with others! The best way to create a great website is to get targeted feedback from others at several points in the process.

## Tips

* You have a lot of autonomy with this project. Make something simple. 

* Think about who you want to view your site (potential employers, freelance opportunities, friends). Make it EASY for your visitors to access the information they want and navigate around the page

* Think about the goal for your site and what you want your users to do (read about your story, look at your work/code/writing, contact you). Guide them to taking those actions by making them prominent / easy to find.

* **Wireframe** what you want your site to look like first!

* **Use proper indentation and organize your code**. Chances are people will view your source!

* The website only needs to be one HTML page.
